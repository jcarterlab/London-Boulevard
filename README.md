# London-Boulevard

The demise of Colin Farrell's character in London Boulevard reminds us that crime can always get in the way of our plans. But how should we account for things like saftey in light of other factors when looking for somewhere to live? This project models data from the Greater London Authority (GLA) to find the best neighbourhoods in London based on the user's relative importance given to rent, green space, travel and saftey.
